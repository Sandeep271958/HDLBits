# HDLBits


This repository contains **my worked-out Verilog solutions** to problems from [**HDLBits**](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) â€” an platform for learning and practicing **digital hardware design using Verilog HDL**.

## About HDLBits

**HDLBits** is a collection of small circuit design exercises focused on helping learners practice **Verilog HDL** through hands-on coding and simulation.

Each exercise asks you to design a small circuit module in Verilog, then immediately tests your design using simulation and comparison with reference solutions.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes solutions across all major HDLBits categories:

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
|  **Getting Started** | Basic modules, syntax, and HDLBits workflow |
|  **Verilog Language** | Practice on syntax, operators, and coding styles |
|  **Combinational Logic** | Logic gates, multiplexers, arithmetic circuits, K-maps |
|  **Sequential Logic** | Flip-flops, counters, shift registers, finite-state machines |
|  **Reading Simulations** | Interpreting waveform outputs to find circuit behavior |
|  **Writing Testbenches** | Creating simulation environments for verifying designs |

Each Folder/Subsection contains a Verilog file (.v) with the exact problem name as in the HDLBits site.
You can test these modules using **Icarus Verilog**, **ModelSim**, or **Vivado**:
